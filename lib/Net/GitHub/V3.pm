=head1 NAME

Net::GitHub::V3 - Github API v3

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Prefer:

    use Net::GitHub;
    my $gh = Net::GitHub->new(
        version => 3,
        login => 'fayland', pass => 'mypass',
        # or
        # access_token => $oauth_token
    );

Or:

    use Net::GitHub::V3;
    my $gh = Net::GitHub::V3->new(
        login => 'fayland', pass => 'mypass',
        # or
        # access_token => $oauth_token
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<http://developer.github.com/v3/>

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

=head3 Authentication

There are two ways to authenticate through GitHub API v3:

=over 4

=item login/pass

    my $gh = Net::GitHub::V3->new( login => $ENV{GITHUB_USER}, pass => $ENV{GITHUB_PASS} );

=item access_token

    my $gh = Net::GitHub->new( access_token => $ENV{GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN} );

=back

=head3 raw_response

    my $gh = Net::GitHub->new(
        # login/pass or access_token
        raw_response => 1
    );

return raw L<HTTP::Response> object

=head3 raw_string

    my $gh = Net::GitHub->new(
        # login/pass or access_token
        raw_string => 1
    );

return L<HTTP::Response> response content as string

=head3 api_throttle

    my $gh = Net::GitHub->new(
        # login/pass or access_token
        api_throttle => 0
    );

To disable call rate limiting (e.g. if your account is whitelisted), set B<api_throttle> to 0.

=head3 RaiseError

By default, error responses are propagated to the user as they are received
from the API. By switching B<RaiseError> on you can make the be turned into
exceptions instead, so that you don't have to check for error response after
every call.

=head3 Iterating over pages: next_url, last_url, prev_url, first_url, per_page

Any methods which return multiple results I<may> be paginated. After performing
a query you should check to see if there are more results. These attributes will
be reset for each query.

The predicates to check these attributes are C<has_next_page>, C<has_last_page>,
C<has_prev_page> and C<has_first_page>.

C<per_page> defaults to 100. It will be applied to GET urls no matter it supports or not.

See Github's documentation: L<http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination>

  my @issues = $gh->issue->repos_issues;
  while ($gh->issue->has_next_page) {
      push @issues, $gh->issue->query($gh->issue->next_url);
      ## OR ##
      push @issues, $gh->issue->next_page;
  }


=head3 Iterating over individual items: next_xxx and close_xxx

The queries which can return paginated results can also be evaluated one by
one, like this:

  while (my $issue = $gh->issue->next_repos_issue( @args )) {
    # do something with $issue
  }

The arguments to next_repos_issue are the same as for repos_issues,
and is also applicable to all other interfaces which offer a next_xxx
method.  All available next_xxx methods are listed in the
documentation of the corresponding modules, see the list below.

If you loop over the next_xxx interfaces, new API calls will be
performed automatically, but only when needed to fetch more items.  An
undefined return value means there are no more items.

To start over with the first item, you need to close the iteration.
Every next_xxx method has a corresponding close_xxx method which must
be called with exactly the same parameters as the next_xxx method to
take effect:

  $gh->issue->close_repos_issue(@args);

If you use Net::GitHub::V3 in a command line program, there is no need
to call the close_xxx methods at all.  As soon as the Net::GitHub::V3
object $gh goes out of scope, everything is neatly cleaned up.

However, if you have a long-lived Net::GitHub::V3 object, e.g. in a
persistent service process which provides an own interface to its
users and talks to GitHub under the hood, then it is advisable to
close the iterations when you're done with them.

For brevity and because they usually are not needed, the close_xxx
methods are not listed with their modules.  It is guaranteed that
I<every> next_xxx method has a corresponding close_xxx method.

=head3 Alternate iterator over individual items:

If next_xxx and close_xxx methods are not available for your pagination
method you can use a generic iterator using the C<iterate> helper.

    $gh->issues->iterate( 'repos_issues', [ @args ], sub {
        my $issue = shift;

        ... # do something with $issue

        return 1; # if you want to continue iterating
        return;   # when you want to interrupt the iteration process
    } );

=head3 ua

To set the proxy for ua, you can do something like following

    $gh->ua->proxy('https', 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050');

$gh->ua is an instance of L<LWP::UserAgent>

=head2 METHODS

=head3 query($method, $url, $data)

    my $data = $gh->query('/user');
    $gh->query('PATCH', '/user', $data);
    $gh->query('DELETE', '/user/emails', [ 'myemail@somewhere.com' ]);

query API directly

=head3 next_page

When the results have been paginated, C<next_page> is sugar for the common case
of iterating through all the pages in order. It simply calls C<query> with the C<next_url>.

=head3 set_default_user_repo

    $gh->set_default_user_repo('fayland', 'perl-net-github'); # take effects for all $gh->
    $gh->repos->set_default_user_repo('fayland', 'perl-net-github'); # take effects on $gh->repos

B<To ease the keyboard, we provided two ways to call any method which starts with :user/:repo>

1. SET user/repos before call methods below

    $gh->set_default_user_repo('fayland', 'perl-net-github');
    my @contributors = $gh->repos->contributors;

2. If it is just for once, we can pass :user, :repo before any arguments

    my @contributors = $repos->contributors($user, $repo);

=head2 MODULES

=head3 user

    my $user = $gh->user->show('nothingmuch');
    $gh->user->update( bio => 'Just Another Perl Programmer' );

L<Net::GitHub::V3::Users>

=head3 repos

    my @repos = $gh->repos->list;
    my $rp = $gh->repos->create( {
        "name" => "Hello-World",
        "description" => "This is your first repo",
        "homepage" => "https://github.com"
    } );
